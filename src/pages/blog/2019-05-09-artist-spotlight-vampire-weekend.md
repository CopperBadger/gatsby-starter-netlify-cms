## Debut: "Vampire Weekend"

I think before I graduated high school, even before I listened to more than a couple of their songs, I knew that Vampire Weekend would be what I first listened to in college.

> I see a mansard roof through the trees / I see a salty message written in the eaves / The ground beneath my feet / The hot garbage and concrete / And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too. *Mansard Roof*

I transferred around a couple of times before I got my bachelor's in computer science, but my first university was a beautiful campus in the countryside that exuded the sort of academic energy that I believed a good university should. A fifty-year-old library with brutalist concrete features and musty books; hidden windowed alcoves furnished for studying; central dining hall by the clock tower overlooking the reflecting pond. The downtown campus, 30 minutes by bus, with uncountable hallways. The classroom building with the secret top-floor room that was always locked and could only be accessed by a single stairway.

Vampire Weekend was the perfect narrator for my years there. Ezra's evocative, brainiac lyrics and the band's inventive instrumental layed over the contours of academic life ("Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather / and Spanish ways to move along" -- *One (Blake's Got a New Face)*) in a way that made me feel immediately informed and confident walking from class to class, grabbing dinner at the student commons, or outlining presentations in the science building. Vampire Weekend was at once the music of some phantom young and intellectual in-crowd with a chronic obsession with tennis and history class (a sentiment Ezra actually echoed in [an interview with The Feed](https://youtu.be/cEWMmCJqs6E?t=148), describing their debut as "college preppy dress-up"), but also the music of a very pivotal time in my life.

<small>**What I Love**: The image of the university water tower that appears in my head whenever I listen; the organ puffing and crooning colorfully through the song; "Why would you lie about how much coal you have? Why would you lie about something dumb like that?" The structure of the song is also very organic.</small>

## Sophomore, Junior: "Contra" and "Modern Vampires of the City"

The group's sophomore effort was essentially an extension on their first-- more heady, quirky indie rock. The bouncy and tongue-twisting "California English" I think will always remind me of the really thick macadamia nut cookies they'd sell at the dining hall that I would get way too often.

> A vegetarian since the invasion / She's never seen the word "Bombs" / She's never seen the word "Bombs" blown up to 96pt Futura. *[Holiday](https://youtu.be/7TrUBRFCkt8)*

"Modern Vampires of the City" -- their third album -- and I both emerged smarter and more complex my junior year. I, with a nebulous novel project and a sketchbook full of wiggly drawings and (later) furry art, and they with dense writings around religion, politics, and geography that beguiled me and drew me further into my own art.

> Oh, sweet thing / Zion doesn't love you / And Babylon don't love you / But you love everything / ... / Through the fire and through the flames / You won't even say your name / Only "I am that I am" / Who could ever live that way? *[Ya Hey](https://youtu.be/i-BznQE6B8U)*

Vampire Weekend has always included one or two slower, more reflective tracks on their albums. On their debut, it was "I Stand Corrected"; on Contra it was "Taxi Cab" and "I Think Ur A Contra". MVotC had "Hudson" -- one of my favorites -- and their long-awaited 2019 release Father of the Bride has "My Mistake"

<small>**What I Love**: "Over and over again, all these never-ending visions." [The Genius page for this song](https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-hudson-lyrics) has some great input on the deeper meaning lurking below the song's creeping bassline and ghostly backing vocals. The following track, Young Lion -- the album's closer -- is an excellent palate cleanser.</small>

## Four Years Later: "Father of the Bride"

Vampire Weekend's latest album came out a few weeks ago, and I've been listening to it for the past four days collecting enough evidence to determine if Vampire Weekend and I have diverged as many of my other favorite bands have, or if we're continuing to grow together. Country-adjacent offerings like the leader "Hold You Now" and "Married in a Gold Rush" worried me, but those fears are assuaged by the stunning and inventive intro to "[Flower Moon](https://youtu.be/uxgGmqyHEqk)", "My Mistake", and the album's swaying and pastoral closer "Jerusalem, New York, Berlin" which one YouTube commenter identifies as "the most vampire weekend song title" (I'm inclinded to agree)

A week later and I figured out how much I loved "Bambina," abrupt and ripped in the middle with an almost Rogue Wave-esque guitar break, "This Life" completely bursting with joyful energy (and enough creative songwriting to legitimize it), and "Unbearably White" whose electric tremolo-string soli after the first chorus has become a little musical treasure to me. Here's my track-by-track breakdown:

---

Note: This took a long time to write and I'm probably not going to do it again.

* **Hold You Now** -- Radio-friendly country tune with folksy wedding imagery that I don't like sliced up by a shimmering and glorious chorus sample from Hans Zimmer's _The Thin Red Line_, according to Wikipedia. Finishes with an "okay" that makes Ezra seem like the guy from A Star Is Born rather than a good songwriter.
* **Harmony Hall** -- I think track is meant to marry the old VW with the new. It meshes call-backs from their older work ("I don't want to live like this / but I want want to die" from "Finger Back", and large, presumably 96pt Futura block titling in the music video) with the gospel tones they trucked in for the first track and a very non-preppy, spatula-wielding Ezra cooking pancakes in the video. Beyond that, however, I'm a little over it; definitely this album's "Viva La Vida" track\*.
* **Bambina** -- Wicked melody in the first prechorus and a surprising ABAB song structure adds a special brevity that makes the song feel more like a sound picture meant to send a quick, calculated message.
* **This Life** -- Songs that aim for a positive vibe don't usually work for me because they're often simple and predictable. This is song aims and hits that note for me with a jubilant instrumental juxtaposed by searching and outspoken lyrics ("Oh Christ! Am I good for nothing?"). Wonderful microscopy music video adds another layer of meaning.
* **Big Blue** -- Simple vamp track with repeated lyrics. Not my favorite.
* **How Long?** -- Quintessential middle-of-the-album track. It's a good jam, you sort of forget that it's there but can sing along to it when it rolls by. But that's also the kind of track that can sneak up on you and become a late favorite after you've gotten used to the rest of the album.
* **Unbearably White** -- Excellent chill-out track. One of the singles, has a ridiculous orchestra hit after the first verse that I'm okay with. Beautiful e-bow / string / something soli after the first chorus takes me to a place no VW song has before.
* **Rich Man** -- No notes. I'm sure there's some deep meaning in the lyrics, but I haven't taken the time to piece it out yet.
* **My Mistake** -- Vampire Weekend's most candid and vulnerable track so far. An excellent achievement.
* **Sympathy** -- Wikipedia says this is a flamenco track, but I don't hear it. It's kind of like a jolt of electricity after the last track, and when it opens with "I think I take myself too serious," I wish I could reply and say no. That was good. I don't know if it's because I keep thinking this song is actually "Long Train Running" by The Doobie Brothers (and I _can't_ be the only one), or because the melody is a lot of same-note shouting, but this one doesn't really get me.
* **Sunflower** -- Another single that made me nervous when I heard it for the first time. A goofy sort of guitar-noodle singalong-- doesn't really get me either.
* **Flower Moon** -- Beyond the beautiful autotune-assisted vocal chorale at the beginning, the most I can say about this tune is that it's a fun jam that really hits the springtime vibes the band was shooting for.
* **2021** -- Another repeated lyrics track. It's nice enough, no notes.
* **We Belong Together** -- I don't like this track. It sounds like Ezra's singing a cutesy love song to this new country vibe and even if it is peppered with VW quirks here and there, I'm just not on board.
* **Stranger** -- Same as above. These two sound like they're off a different damn album, quacky saxophones and all. I don't even know if I've listened to this one all the way through.
* **Spring Snow** -- Not heard this one a lot, but I dig the weird autotune intro. I could see it becoming another late favorite.
* **Jerusalem, New York, Berlin** -- An old-school VW title with classic VW lyrics over a distinctive VW booping and tinkling instrumental that still somehow feels more apiece here than it would have in any of their previous releases.

\* op. cit., "Viva La Vida" by Coldplay, which was simultaneously the album's most popular track but also one that I quickly got bored with and usually skipped.
