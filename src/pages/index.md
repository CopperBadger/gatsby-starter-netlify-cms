  Hey, I'm Copper. I'm just setting things up, but I'm planning on using this
  space to yap about music, tech, games, and just about anything else I feel
  like. I'll probably tweet out when I make a post here on Twitter,
  @copperbadger. Oh and if you see anything about coffee on this site just
  ignore it-- it's just what the template came with lol

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
