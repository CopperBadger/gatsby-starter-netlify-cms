## The Last Few Years

Three years ago I realized that I was missing out. I didn't read for fun. I didn't watch movies, or shows. I played hardly any games. I don't know why it took me so long but it wasn't until my 2017 resolution to seek out those new experiences that I realized, all at once, there were worlds and worlds of great experiences I had just been dismissing. Worlds and worlds and I would spend my free time coding and watching Game Grumps. Those first months were like a renaissance. The school week was hard -- the hardest it had ever been, actually -- but it made those weekend escapes at my parents' reading Lord of the Rings, playing Stardew Valley, and watching Star Trek all the more incredible. It was pure joy for a great while.

A year and a half ago I graduated from college and my doctor stopped prescribing my ADD medication. Which was fine because I wanted to try living without it anyway. My parents and I moved. I jumped between a couple of jobs. By 2019 I was different and had stepped into a different life set up with a great job, but also rumbling with vague anxieties, plagued with scattered and racing thoughts, and drained with unshakable insomnia. The whole year was a great laboring effort to piece together a puzzle and the pieces didn't fit. It was a struggle to even just relax, let alone feel much joy in the brief and desperate flashes of time between work, sleep, and an 80-minute commute.

This was one of my favorites during my Michigan trip

In December I got my fursuit and [went to MFF](https://twitter.com/Ghimno/status/1204106484096913408), which I had been anticipating for a long time and I'm sure I'll talk about at some point. But I also went to Michigan to visit with family for Christmas and take chilly walks outside listening to Sufjan Stevens, and when I returned I was different again.

If 2019 was me tumbling over and getting back up for twelve months, I'm confident (or at least hopeful) that 2020 will be me standing, walking, and running again. In this first month I've already bought a house and planned out a trip to visit some new friends in Ohio. I've also just felt a lot better.

I admit that over the past years my motivation to "track" anything outside of work has diminished because it's been really hard for me to find the point in it, but if I have anyone reading this then I suppose it's worth it. My current plan is to use these posts as a way to share games, music, movies, books, and other things I've tried during the month alongside some standard life updates in a format that is efficient to read and (hopefully) efficient to write.
