Two Thursdays ago, a friend of mine shared some trance music with me and our friends in the car on the way to Starbucks at like 9:00pm, and I was reminded of a song I heard a few years back on [a Disasterpeace set on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/datagarden/programme-009-guest-mix-by-1) called **"The Pining Pt. 1" by Clark**. I texted it to him across the coffee shop from a chair while he waited in line, "On the topic of sharing electronic songs, I love this one and I feel like you might too."

"You just said the wrong combination of words to me because now I'm not going to stop sharing music with you," he said, or something like that.

He and I went back and forth over the next couple of days sharing artists, and I thought if I was going to take the time to walk through a bunch of the music I love then I should figure out a more public and permanent way to do it than Telegram messages. This blog is how I decided to make that happen.

### The Music

Not all of my posts will be about music, but for the ones that are I have some ideas. Ever since my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist started exclusively playing meditative piano tracks, I've been searching for ways to discover new music. I want my posts to help you navigate the chunks of the music world I love in a curated, unautomated way.

To do that, in each of my music posts I will try to give you at least one or two **"In The Neighborhood"** links to similar artists, and why you might also like them. Or at least I'll try to do that-- at the very least I'll be tagging my posts by genre and mood so you can browse that way as well.

Our relationship with music goes beyond what it sounds like, and what's meaningful and accessible to one listner is a total miss for another, which is why I plan to include stories and **"What I Love"** blurbs with each track or artist I write about.

### The Other Stuff

Who knows what else will pop up here! I'm a furry, a professional software developer, a college graduate, a not-too-serious gamer, and just a person who thinks about stuff and loves new experiences-- expect some general non-music posts here and there.
