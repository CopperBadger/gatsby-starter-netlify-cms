## Debut: "Vampire Weekend"

I think before I graduated high school, even before I listened to more than a couple of their songs, I knew that Vampire Weekend would be what I first listened to in college.

> I see a mansard roof through the trees / I see a salty message written in the eaves / The ground beneath my feet / The hot garbage and concrete / And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too. *Mansard Roof*

I transferred around a couple of times before I got my bachelor's in computer science, but my first university was a beatiful campus in the countryside that exuded the sort of academic energy a good university should. A library with brutalist concrete features constructed fifty years ago; hidden windowed alcoves furnished for studying; central dining hall by the clock tower overlooking the reflecting pond. The downtown campus, 30 minutes by bus, with uncountable hallways. The classroom building with the secret top-floor room that was always locked and could only be accessed by one stairway.

Vampire Weekend so perfectly off-ramped from my weird little post-high school summer and into college that I wonder if there wasn't some kind of higher power at play. Ezra's evocative brainiac lyrics layed over the contours of academic life ("Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather" -- *One (Blake's Got a New Face)*) in a way that made me feel immediately at home walking the halls, grabbing dinner at the student commons, or browsing the library of my new surroundings. Vampire Weekend was the music of some phantom intellectual in-crowd that got straight A's and dressed for golf or tennis anywhere they went, but somehow managed not to be complete nerds or insufferable snobs. Just cool, stand-up folks.

<small>**What I Love**: The image of the university water tower that appears in my head whenever I listen; the organ puffing and crooning colorfully through the song; "Why would you lie about how much coal you have? Why would you lie about something dumb like that?" The structure of the song is also very organic.</small>

## Sophomore, Junior: "Contra" and "Modern Vampires of the City"

The group's sophomore effort was no slouch, though doesn't stick out was much in my head, and I think that's understandable for something you're experiencing the second time around. Still "California English" reminds of the really thick macadamia nut cookies they'd sell at the dining hall that I would get way too often.

> A vegetarian since the invasion / She's never seen the word "Bombs" / She's never seen the word "Bombs" blown up to 96pt Futura. *[Holiday](https://youtu.be/7TrUBRFCkt8)*

"Modern Vampires of the City" -- their third album -- and I both emerged smarter and more complex my junior year. I, with a nebulous novel project and a sketchbook, and they with challenging themes around religion, politics, and geography that beguiled me and drew me further into my own art.

> Oh, sweet thing / Zion doesn't love you / And Babylon don't love you / But you love everything / ... / Through the fire and through the flames / You won't even say your name / Only "I am that I am" / Who could ever live that way? *[Ya Hey](https://youtu.be/i-BznQE6B8U)*

Vampire Weekend has always included one or two slower, more reflective pieces on their albums. On their debut, it was "I Stand Corrected"; on Contra it was "Taxi Cab" and "I Think Ur A Contra". MVotC had "Hudson" -- one of my favorites -- and their long-awaited 2019 release Father of the Bride has "My Mistake"

<small>**What I Love**: "Over and over again, all these never-ending visions." [The genius page for this song](https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-hudson-lyrics) has some great input on the deeper meaning lurking below the song's creeping bassline and ghostly backing vocals. The following track, Young Lion -- the album's closer -- is an excellent palate cleanser.</small>

## Four Years Later: "Father of the Bride"

Vampire Weekend's latest album came out a few weeks ago, and I've been listening to it for the past four days collecting enough evidence to determine if Vampire Weekend and I have diverged as many of my other favorite bands have, or if we're continuing to grow together. Country-infused offerings like the leader "Hold You Now" and "Married in a Gold Rush" make me worried, but those fears are at least in part assuaged by the stunning and inventive intro to "[Flower Moon](https://youtu.be/uxgGmqyHEqk)", "My Mistake", and the album's swaying and pastoral closer "Jeruselam, New York, Berlin" which one YouTube commenter identifies as "the most vampire weekend song title" (I'm inclinded to agree)
